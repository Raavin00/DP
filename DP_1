problem Statement : -
      There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top.
The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, 
the person can reach the top (order does matter).


Solution:-

class Solution
{
    //Function to count number of ways to reach the nth stair.
    int countWays(int n)
    {
        
        // your code here
        if(n<=2) return n;
        int dp[]= new int[n+1];
        dp[1]=1;
        dp[2]=2;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            dp[i]=(dp[i-1]+dp[i-2])%1000000007;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
